# CS50_AI

This set of folders each represent a project made by me for the EdX course
CS50's Intro to Artificial Intelligence with Python, from Cambridge University.

It holds several IA algorythms, from search to convolutional neural networks
for image recognition and knowledge representation.

A certificate from this course can be found in my linkedin page:
